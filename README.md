#ImageExport

ImageExport came into action when we needed to resize our high resolution application icons to the various formats and dimensions set by the different mobile platforms (i.e. iOS, Android and Windows Phone). 

## Features

- Enter export rules into ImageExport to resize one image into multiple sizes.
- Export the rules into ImageExport Rule List (IRL file)
- Import ImageExport Rule List (IRL file)
